# Level 2 Task 10 -Refactoring

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● For this task, you are required to refactor the badly written program in the
Factory folder.

● The factory pattern is a method that returns one of several possible classes that share a common superclass. It is particularly useful when you don’t know beforehand what class you need and the decision can only be made at run time. The superclass that the Factory pattern uses is usually implemented as an interface. An interface is a special type of class that acts as a blueprint of classes to come. It is an abstract type that specifies the behaviour of future classes. An interface will contain method headings but the methods in an interface don’t contain any logic. The logic for the methods specified in the interface is written in the classes that implement the interface. In essence, an interface shows a class what to do, and not how to do it.

● It is not vital for you to be familiar with design patterns for this task, but you can read more about them here(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern).

● For this task be sure to:

○ Troubleshoot and debug the code first so that it runs correctly.

○ Fix the indentation and formatting of the code so that it adheres to the guidelines provided here(https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4-formatting).

○ Make sure that all the names of variables, classes, methods, etc. adhere to the guidelines provided here (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.1-identifier-names).

○ Refactor the code to improve the quality and readability of the code in other ways highlighted in this task.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● For this task, you are required to refactor the badly written program in the Decorator folder.

● The decorator pattern adds something extra to an object that already exists. It wraps an object in order to add functionality or features to the object. The purpose of the pattern is to make it easy to add or remove functions if needed. This is done by wrapping a single object (not class) to add new behaviour. It has an attribute for that object and has all the same methods as the wrapped object.
